# Experiment-9
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a wide collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are faster and consume less memory because they store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. This makes NumPy highly efficient for mathematical and statistical operations.

The core object of NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array), which allows handling 1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional data. Attributes such as:

ndim → gives the number of dimensions

size → gives total number of elements

shape → gives the structure of the array

dtype → gives the data type of elements

NumPy provides several built-in functions to create arrays easily:

np.zeros() → Creates an array filled with zeros

np.ones() → Creates an array filled with ones

np.eye() → Creates an identity matrix

np.arange() → Generates numbers within a range

np.linspace() → Generates evenly spaced values

NumPy also supports vectorized operations, meaning arithmetic operations can be performed directly on arrays without using loops (e.g., addition, multiplication, etc.).

It includes powerful statistical functions such as:

mean()

median()

max()

min()

sum()

NumPy serves as the foundation for advanced libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and Machine Learning frameworks, making it essential in data science and scientific research.


✅ Conclusion

The study of the NumPy library shows that it is an efficient and powerful tool for numerical computations in Python. It simplifies array creation, mathematical calculations, and statistical operations while improving speed and performance compared to traditional lists. Therefore, NumPy plays a vital role in data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning applications.
